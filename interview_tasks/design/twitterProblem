Statement: Design a simplified version of Twitter where people can post tweets, follow other people and favorite tweets.

Questions:
Q1:
how many users do we expect this system to handle? - let’s aim for 10 million users generating around 100 million requests per day

Q2:
That’s great but let’s continue. Since we have the notion of following someone, how connected will these users be? 
After all, they will form a graph with the users being the nodes and the edges will represent who follows whom.
we expect that each user will be following 200 other users on average, but expect some extraordinary users with tens of thousands of followers

Conclusion:
Let’s make a few very simple calculations with the information we just received. 
We will have around 10 million users. Average number of followed other users is 200. 
This means that the network of users will have about 200 * 10 million edges. 
This makes 2 billion edges. If the average number of tweets per day is 10 million the number of favorites will then be 20 million.

To summarize, here are some more things we now know:
10 million users
10 million tweets per day
20 million tweet favorites per day
100 million HTTP requests to the site
2 billion “follow” relations
Some users and tweets could generate an extraordinary amount of traffic
