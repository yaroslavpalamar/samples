1 run script as
 python server.py
2 open second terminal and run next command
telnet 127.0.0.1 5005

3 open third terminal and listen the port 5005 (in local machine need to listen lo0 interface)
sudo tcpdump -vv -x -X -s 1500 -i lo0 'port 5005'

4 Also instead of telnet you can send next data ussing nc command
